This project uses the Android Studio wizard and Blank Activity to create a project. It integrates two separate paths for Robolectric integration in two separate branches.

Branch `blundell` is based off of [his blog recommendations](http://blog.blundell-apps.com/android-gradle-app-with-robolectric-junit-tests/) .
Branch `robojava` uses a
[plugin](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric-gradle-plugin).

Neither fully explained the work required to start a new project with Robolectric. This repo will be distilled and published in my forthcoming [book](http://coreylatislaw.com/android-activity-book/).
